# Meeting Notes

## 03/14/2020
Fluid simulation is new to both of us, so there is a lot of reading and learning to be done before we start coding this.

What do we need to know before we start writing code:
- How to write numerical simulations.
- Find existing tools and play with them, if possible.

Abstract: Two-dimensional hydrodynamic codes are used to simulate the growth 
of perturbations at an interface between two fluids of different density due 
to Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Problems where the interface is subjected to a 
constant acceleration and where it is accelerated and decelerated by shock 
waves are considered. Emphasis is placed on the case when the initial 
perturbation consists of many different wavelength modes. Results are compared 
with the experimental data of Andronov et al. (1976) and Read (1983). The use 
of a simple empirical model of the mixing process based on the equations of 
two-phase flow is discussed.
